Question: https//leetcode.com/problems/climbing-stairs/
You are climbing a staircase. It takes n steps to reach the top.

Each time you can either climb 1 or 2 steps. 
In how many distinct ways can you climb to the top?
Example 1:

Input: n = 2
Output: 2
Explanation: There are two ways to climb to the top.
1. 1 step + 1 step
2. 2 steps
Example 2:

Input: n = 3
Output: 3
Explanation: There are three ways to climb to the top.
1. 1 step + 1 step + 1 step
2. 1 step + 2 steps
3. 2 steps + 1 step
